# My-Own-Game-Engine

Creating my own graphics engine from scratch using DirectX 11 has been an intense yet rewarding learning experience. I started by understanding the fundamentals of rendering pipelines, shaders, and resource management. Setting up a proper window, initializing Direct3D, and handling swap chains were my first hurdles.

From there, I dived deep into vertex and index buffers, learning how to render basic 3D objects and implement transformations. Shaders and HLSL were another challenge, but mastering them unlocked a new level of visual possibilities. Optimizing performance, managing memory efficiently, and debugging rendering issues became a crucial part of my workflow.

One of the most satisfying moments was implementing a real-time lighting system and seeing my objects illuminated dynamically. Handling input, physics, and even exploring ECS (Entity Component Systems) further expanded my understanding of game architecture.

Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve gained a deep appreciation for how modern game engines work under the hood. While there were countless roadblocks, each challenge pushed me to grow as a programmer. This project has not only improved my technical skills but also solidified my passion for game development.
